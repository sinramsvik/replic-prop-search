Property price estimate POC
Bootstrapped using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), deployed on [Vercel](https://property-search-eight.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

```bash
pnpm install &&
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Core functionality:

- [Single address search](https://property-search-eight.vercel.app/single-address) - Search in Mapbox, get value estimate and sold price for a single property
- [Single address search with richer data](https://property-search-eight.vercel.app/single-address-rich) - Same as above, but lists all available raw data for a single property.
- [Map explorer (TODO)](https://property-search-eight.vercel.app/explore) - Maybe heat layers or statistic showing trends, statistics and other snacks while browsing the map?
